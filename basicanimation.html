          <h2>04.01.02 Activity Diagram</h2>
          <p>
            I was introduced to the concept of Activity Diagrams, how they are
            used to help streamline the process of game design. My extensive
            knowledge of video games helped me grasp the concept quicker then I
            expected. After learning about each shape that comes into play
            concerning the diagram and what they indicate I went to work on my
            diagram. I made mine in Adobe Illustrator but that was a mistake as
            I later found out that there are many options online that simplify
            the process of creating one.

          <h2>04.02.02 Peer Review</h2>
          <p>
            As the title of the assignment is “peer review” it was quite obvious
            what It would contain. However during this project I learned about
            the importance of getting feedback from your peers when going
            through the development faces of game design. In this review I
            watched five paper prototypes from my peers and answered a pre-made
            questionnaire as honestly as possible. After getting the reviews
            from my peers, I went to work on the problems that were pointed out
            to me. Those things that I worked on were minor details in the
            prototype that weren’t so clear, so after thinking about how to make
            those clearer I finished up my prototype.

          <h2>04.02.03 Asset List and Design Documentation</h2>
          <p>
            After being taught how to make an Asset List, I started working with
            the html code needed for the list. Within the code I documented all
            my illustrations and UI elements. With all of the code ready I
            hosted it on my domain. I was also introduced to the concept of
            Design Documentation and how it’s necessary for the finished
            product. In my Design Documentation I go into detail about how I
            work with video game, flat design and kawaii inspirations for my
            illustrations. Within the document I display my style tile and
            moodboard. I also show my sketching process for my characters and my
            UI elements. Finally in the document I also depict a scene from the
            game.

          <h2>04.05.02 The Finished Game</h2>
          <p>
            In this module I was introduced to JavaScript, because to animate
            the illustrations I made I would need to do so with JavaScript. The
            lectures on JavaScript were comprehensible and helped me with the
            basic understanding of the game. However, during this module I fell
            quite ill and was in bad spot mentally so I never got to work on the
            project itself in any presentable way, therefore I have nothing to
            show except a scene from the game I hoped to make. But looking back
            now I’m filled with excitement to try on my own. When making this
            site I did my best to include some animated parts to the website and
            look forward to learning more.
