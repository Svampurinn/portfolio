              <h2>02.01.01 Russian Constructivism</h2>
              <p>
                After being introduced to basic html/css, Gestalt Laws,
                Typography and color, I set to work on my website about Russian
                constructivism. I found the project to be quite daunting at
                first so I started with designing small icons and illustrations
                to use for my website. Putting the Gestalt laws of proximity and
                similarity to use, I made it so that each heading was the same
                font and size as the other, I also did the same with the
                paragraphs. In my illustrations I worked with the laws of
                figure-ground, proximity and continuity.

          <h2>02.02.01 History of the Micro Computer</h2>
          <p>
            For this assignment we were introduced to the concept of wireframes
            and how they could aid us in the design process. During my lectures
            I also learned about CSS grid and how to utilise that function to
            design my layout within the code. I also Learned about some new html
            tags that were relevant to use in my project, such as "abbr" and
            "a"( internal links). I struggled a lot with getting the grid
            function to work in the code. However, the internet was my best
            friend during this process. The CSS grid function was mostly used in
            the layout of the navigation bar. However, it played a huge role in
            blocking the text.

          <h2>02.03.01 Interest Based Website</h2>
          <p>
            I was introduced to different design styles for this project, when
            presented a few options I ended up picking Material Design because I
            wanted to learn how to work with icons and I felt it suited the
            topic of Climate Change. After learning about the different types of
            test, such as The Trunk test and the 5 second test. Implementing
            these tests give me a bit of insight into the needs and preferences
            of the user. I found myself in a deeper part of the pool then I
            expected, So trying my best to implement the theories and
            components, I ended up with a website far from my vision. Even
            though I believed that I failed and came from this project richer in
            experience.
