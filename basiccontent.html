          <h2>05.01.01 A Story Without Words</h2>
          <p>
            Our introduction into the theme of basic content was to direct, film
            and edit a short film, however we were tasked to tell the story
            without words. The group got together and settled on a idea for the
            film and with that direction in mind we went to work. During our
            lectures we learned about recording techniques, colour theory,
            equipment and about the basics of editing. Our group wanted to tell
            the story of burnout at work, so we created a set at a group members
            house that could depict an office/home. We focused on quick close
            ups of ordinary things to show the passing of time, such as waking
            up, making coffee and going to bed. We felt that this conveyed the
            passing of time. After filming was done we all sat down to work on
            editing, I had the most experience out our group, so I found it to
            be quite easy. We all worked on the editing until we were satisfied

          <h2>05.02.02 Treatment</h2>
          <p>
            In this project we were tasked with creating three videos for a
            start-up company called Cherry pop and their focus was to improve
            sex education in Denmark. We were taught the concept of a treatment
            and how by following the path of theme, logline and finally the
            treatment itself we could streamline the starting process of making
            a film. The group sat down to brainstorm a few ideas and after our
            discussion we settled on an idea. With our idea in mind we went to
            work on our treatments, we all made one individually and then after
            discussing as a group decided on an treatment that followed the
            story of a kid struggling with access to safe and correct
            information regarding sex

          <h2>05.03.01 Storyboard</h2>
          <p>
            Working in a group undermanned group we had to allocate jobs in a
            way so that we would be able to finish the project. In our lectures
            we were introduced to the importance of a Storyboard when it comes
            to film making. The Storyboard depicts the flow of the scenes
            throughout the film, such as camera angles, dialogue, audio and
            movement. However, I was tasked with filming the scenes and editing
            the films. So with a storyboard made by a group member I started
            filming. After gathering all my shots I sent them to the other
            members for approval. After getting approval from my group I started
            editing the films. In the editing process I was thankful for my
            experience in editing as it made the process easier, however I had
            to learn some new things to complete the project in they way we
            envisioned, such as how to create an coloured background with text
            and effects.

          <h2>05.03.02 Customer Pitch</h2>
          <p>
            For the final project concerning the task set by Cherry pop and our
            teachers, we had to make a Peach Kucha presentation. After our
            lecture on Pecha Kucha where we were taught that these types of
            presentations are made in a way where each slide is short, concise
            and to the point. One of our members made the presentation and the
            rest had to write out a twenty second long text for each of our
            slides that we were to present.
