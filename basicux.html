          <h2>03.01.01 Data Collection</h2>
          <p>
            During this module, I learned about how to conduct Market Research
            or in simpler terms, data collection. My objective was to find a
            common problem within the world of UX and bring forth a solution. So
            after learning about both desk and secondary research and how you
            can confirm your findings through interviews, surveys and
            questionnaires. So armed with this knowledge I conducted my research
            both online and by observing the problem in real time.

          <h2>03.02.01 Early Prototype</h2>
          <p>
            For this assignment we were put into groups. Where I learned how to
            best work with other people when it comes to this kind of project.
            After being assigned a group I learned about different types of
            prototyping, such as the crazy 8, paper prototyping and UX
            storyboards. After sharing out initial sketches and prototypes the
            group came to a decision concerning the direction of the project. We
            decided on a web-shop that sells “designer eco-friendly t-shirts”.
            After working with the paper prototype and utilising the think aloud
            test we had a clearer goal to work towards.

          <h2>03.03.01 Solution</h2>
          <p>
            Working in a group we allocated jobs to each member. I was tasked
            with Designing my own Illustrations that would be placed on a
            t-shirt for sale on the web-shop, I also wrote documented and wrote
            about our Content Decisions and finally I was supposed to design a
            logo for our “company” so I drew up some ideas and finalised them in
            Adobe Illustrator, however we ended up not using them for the final
            product. Through this whole process I learned about the intricacies
            that go into creating an illustration for a t-shirt, to be aware of
            how every decision needs to both cater to the user and to the design
            integrity. The importance of a persona was clear to me from the get
            go on how we should design our shop.
