        <p>
          A 23 year old country bumpkin from Iceland making his way through all
          the different aspects of the digital world, born and raised in a small
          town outside of the capitol where all your needs are met, be it
          entertainment, education or love. I grew up in a household full of
          "the latest tech" because of my fathers occupation, with my hands full
          of devices I found love in all things digital. During my years in high
          school i came to the unfourtnate conclousion that i didn't have the
          brains for Computer Science and over time i fell in love with digital
          design. Armed with this revolation I set my sights on a higher
          education in Digital design, so I headed to Denmark. Today I'm a
          student at KEA enrolled in the Multimedia Design course.
